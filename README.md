A "Serverless Resource Configuration Tuner" refers to a tool or system designed to automatically optimize
the configuration settings of serverless resources, such as functions and associated components, 
in a cloud computing environment. Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. 
This includes serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and others.
